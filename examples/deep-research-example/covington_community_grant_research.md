# Grant Research Report: Solo-Owned Community Projects in Covington, KY

**Date:** April 1, 2025
**Project:** Grant Research: Covington, KY Community Projects (ID: `proj_a67039840514408386ec549c53668a8b`)

## Executive Summary

This report details findings on grant opportunities for individuals seeking to start or manage community projects, such as community gardens, in Covington, Kentucky. Research indicates that **direct grant funding for solo individuals is limited**. Most federal, state, and foundation grants require applicants to be registered non-profits, government entities, schools, or tribes.

However, several viable pathways exist, primarily through **collaboration and partnership**:

1.  **Forming Informal Groups:** Applying as a small, resident-led group (even informal ones) is often accepted, particularly for local programs like the Covington Neighborhood Grant.
2.  **Partnering with Existing Organizations:** Collaborating with established non-profits (like The Center for Great Neighborhoods) or schools can provide access to grants requiring organizational status.
3.  **Fiscal Sponsorship:** Utilizing a fiscal sponsor allows individuals to apply for grants under the umbrella of a registered non-profit.

The most promising local opportunity is the **Covington Neighborhood Grant Program**, facilitated by The Center for Great Neighborhoods, which supports resident-led group projects. Technical assistance for grant writing is available through various state and local organizations.

## Matching Grant Opportunities

## Conclusion & Recommendation

Funding a solo-led community project in Covington requires strategic planning. While direct individual grants are scarce, opportunities significantly increase through collaboration. **The most recommended approach for an individual is to partner with neighbors to form a small group or work directly with The Center for Great Neighborhoods ([https://www.greatneighborhoods.org](https://www.greatneighborhoods.org)).** CfGN can provide guidance, assist with applications for the Neighborhood Grant Program, and potentially act as a fiscal sponsor or connector for other funding sources requiring organizational status. Exploring the KYSU Small-Scale Farm Grant ([https://www.kysu.edu/academics/college-ahnr/school-of-anr/co-op/small-scale-farm-grant-program.php](https://www.kysu.edu/academics/college-ahnr/school-of-anr/co-op/small-scale-farm-grant-program.php)) or specific GrantWatch listings ([https://www.grantwatch.com](https://www.grantwatch.com)) are secondary options if eligibility criteria are met. Leveraging available technical assistance resources (like GRKY: [https://grantreadyky.org](https://grantreadyky.org)) is also highly advised.
