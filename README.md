## Overview

### Model Context Protocol Server

ATLAS implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP), created by Anthropic, which is a standardized communication protocol between LLMs and external systems. The architecture consists of:

- **Clients** (Claude Desktop, IDEs) that maintain server connections
- **Servers** that provide tools and resources to clients
- **LLMs** that interact with servers through client applications

This architecture creates a secure boundary between LLMs and external systems while enabling controlled access to functionality.

### Core Components

ATLAS is built on several robust core components organized into specialized subsystems:

#### Task Management
- **TaskStore**: Advanced task storage system with:
  * Atomic operations with transaction support
  * Optimistic concurrency control
  * Automatic rollback on failures
  * Hierarchical task validation (max 5 levels recommended)
  * Duplicate task name prevention within same parent
  * Comprehensive error context and recovery suggestions

- **Status Management**:
  * Advanced state machine with transition rules
  * Intelligent status propagation with deadlock prevention
  * Optimistic locking with automatic retry
  * Transaction-based status updates with rollback
  * Bulk operation support with relaxed rules
  * Race condition handling and lock timeouts
  * Parent-child status synchronization
  * Status transition guidance and suggestions
  * Automatic dependency-based blocking
  * Flexible completion rules for parallel work

- **Dependency System**:
  * Advanced dependency validation with caching
  * Circular dependency detection with depth limits (max 10 levels)
  * Intelligent parallel work support
  * Completion requirement enforcement
  * Dependency chain validation
  * Self-dependency prevention
  * Duplicate dependency detection
  * Batch validation for efficiency
  * Cache invalidation and cleanup
  * Dependency impact analysis
  * Deletion safety checks
  * Status-aware dependency rules

- **Transaction Handling**:
  * ACID-compliant operations with retry logic
  * Intelligent operation grouping and batching
  * Conflict detection and resolution
  * Automatic timeout handling (30s default)
  * Operation limits (1000 per transaction)
  * Transaction statistics and monitoring
  * Optimized operation ordering
  * Automatic rollback on failure
  * Transaction state persistence
  * Comprehensive error context

- **Performance Optimization**:
  * Multi-dimensional task indexing
  * Parallel index operations
  * Configurable batch processing
  * Memory-optimized data structures
  * Real-time index statistics

  * Recovery suggestions
  * Operation rollback
  * State consistency checks
  * Validation error prevention
  * Clear error messages

#### System Infrastructure
- **StorageManager**: Provides durable data persistence with SQLite integration
- **SessionManager**: Handles session lifecycle and task list management
- **ConfigManager**: Manages environment-based configuration
- **ValidationSystem**: Ensures data integrity with Zod schema integration

#### Performance & Monitoring
- **RateLimiter**: Controls request rates (600 req/min)
- **HealthMonitor**: Tracks system health with comprehensive metrics
- **MetricsCollector**: Gathers detailed performance statistics
- **RequestTracer**: Traces request flow with debugging capabilities

Through the MCP protocol, ATLAS empowers LLMs to break down complex projects into manageable tasks, track their progress, and maintain dependencies — all within an organized hierarchical structure.

## Installation

### Setup Steps

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cyanheads/atlas-mcp-server.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd atlas-mcp-server
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

4. Build the project:
```bash
npm run build
```

5. Create a storage directory for tasks:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/Documents/atlas-tasks
```

The server is now ready to be configured and used with your MCP client.

## Configuration

ATLAS requires configuration in your MCP client settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "atlas": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/atlas-mcp-server/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "TASK_STORAGE_DIR": "/path/to/storage/directory"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| TASK_STORAGE_DIR | Directory for task data storage | Yes |

## Task Structure

Tasks support rich content, metadata, and reasoning documentation within a hierarchical structure (maximum 5 levels deep). All task operations are transactional with automatic validation using Zod schemas:

```typescript
{
  "name": "Implementation Task",
  "description": "Implement core functionality",
  "type": "task",
  "notes": [
    {
      "type": "markdown",
      "content": "# Requirements\n- Feature A\n- Feature B"
    },
    {
      "type": "code",
      "language": "typescript",
      "content": "interface Feature {\n  name: string;\n  enabled: boolean;\n}"
    }
  ],
  "reasoning": {
    "approach": "Modular development with focus on reusability",
    "assumptions": [
      "System supports TypeScript",
      "Features can be toggled independently"
    ],
    "alternatives": [
      "Monolithic implementation",
      "Feature flags in configuration"
    ],
    "risks": [
      "Increased complexity from modularity",
      "Performance overhead from dynamic loading"
    ],
    "tradeoffs": [
      "Flexibility vs simplicity",
      "Runtime performance vs maintainability"
    ],
    "constraints": [
      "Must maintain backward compatibility",
      "Must work in all supported browsers"
    ],
    "dependencies_rationale": [
      "Depends on core module for type definitions",
      "Requires configuration service for feature flags"
    ],
    "impact_analysis": [
      "Affects system startup time",
      "Changes how features are loaded and managed"
    ]
  },
  "metadata": {
    "context": "Core implementation phase",
    "tags": ["core", "implementation"]
  }
}
```

The reasoning field provides structured documentation of decision-making, which is indexed for efficient search and retrieval:
- **approach**: High-level implementation strategy
- **assumptions**: Key assumptions made during planning
- **alternatives**: Other approaches that were considered
- **risks**: Potential issues and challenges
- **tradeoffs**: Key decisions and their implications
- **constraints**: Technical or business limitations
- **dependencies_rationale**: Reasoning for task dependencies
- **impact_analysis**: Analysis of changes on the system

### Task Storage Features

- **Validation**: Zod schema validation for all fields
- **Caching**: Automatic caching with invalidation
- **Indexing**: Full-text search on content and metadata
- **Transactions**: ACID compliance for all operations
- **Performance**: Optimized retrieval with batch support
- **History**: Change tracking and version management

### Example Task List (Without reasoning)

The following example demonstrates a task breakdown for a personal portfolio website project, showcasing the hierarchical structure and metadata capabilities. The task list was generated from the following prompt:
> Create a comprehensive task plan for a modern, responsive personal portfolio website that showcases a web developer's projects, skills, and professional experience, incorporating best practices in UI/UX design, performance optimization, and accessibility. The site should feature an elegant, minimalist design with smooth animations, dark/light mode support, and interactive project demonstrations, while ensuring cross-browser compatibility and optimal load times.
