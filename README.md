ATLAS (Adaptive Task & Logic Automation System) is a Model Context Protocol server designed for LLMs to manage complex projects. Built with TypeScript and featuring Neo4j graph database integration, efficient project management, and collaborative features, ATLAS provides LLM Agents project management capabilities through a clean, flexible tool interface.

> **Important Version Note**: [Version 1.5.4](https://github.com/cyanheads/atlas-mcp-server/releases/tag/v1.5.4) is the last version that uses SQLite as the database. Version 2.0 and onwards has been completely rewritten to use Neo4j, which requires either:
> - Self-hosting using Docker (docker-compose included in repository)
> - Using Neo4j AuraDB cloud service: https://neo4j.com/product/auradb/

## Database Backup and Restore

ATLAS provides both automated and manual database backup and restore capabilities.

### Automated Backups

The system is configured to automatically back up the Neo4j database on a schedule.  The default schedule is every 6 hours, but this can be customized via the `BACKUP_SCHEDULE` environment variable (see [Configuration](#configuration)).  The number of retained backups is also configurable.

### Manual Backup and Restore (CLI)

You can manually manage backups using the provided command-line interface.  These commands are available as npm scripts:

#### Export (Backup)

To create a backup, use the `db:export` script:

```bash
npm run db:export
```

This will create a JSON file in the `backups/` directory with a timestamp in the filename (e.g., `backups/neo4j_export_YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.json`).

You can also specify a custom file path:

```bash
npm run db:export -- --file=path/to/my_backup.json
```

#### Import (Restore)

To restore the database from a backup file, use the `db:import` script:

```bash
npm run db:import -- --file=path/to/backup.json
```

**Important:** By default, the import process *clears the existing database* before restoring from the backup.  To prevent this, use the `--no-clear` option:

```bash
npm run db:import -- --file=path/to/backup.json --no-clear
```

#### List Backups

To list available backup files, use the `db:list` script:

```bash
npm run db:list
```

This will display a list of backup files with their filenames, paths, sizes, and creation dates.
